# PasswordGenerator

## Description

<p>The motivation for this project was to demonstrate my understanding of Javascript.
<br>
Building this project has helped me have a better understanding of Javascript and allowed me to 
practice my skills using Javascript and critical thinking. 
<br>
Included in the critical thinking, the project has helped me become comfortable with finding solutions to problems
<br>
finding the solutions was one part but understanding how the new information can be integrated to solve issues was another large learning experience.
<br>
The password generator will help users create passwords without 
having any subconcious thoughts slip into the password creation. 
<br>
This allows for passwords to be more difficult to find or deduce from possible personal
information that can be found on the internet.</p>

## Usage

Proceed to webpage  
when ready click 'generate password'  
Answer the prompts  
Once they have been answers a password with the desired criteria will be displayed
